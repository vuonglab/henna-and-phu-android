# CONTRIBUTING

## Fixing bugs

If you find a bug, create a feature branch off the master branch and give it a descriptive name. Make the fix in the feature branch. When finished, submit a pull request for your changes to be reviewed and merged into the master branch.

## Adding new features

Before adding a new feature or making substantial changes, please file an issue first so we can all agree on the proposed feature or changes.
